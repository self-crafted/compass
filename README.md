## Install
You can download a binary from the [releases](https://github.com/self-crafted/compass/releases/latest).
If you want to compile it yourself, make sure you have a JDK 17 installed and execute following commands:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/self-crafted/compass.git
cd compass
./gradlew build
```
The binary will be located at `./build/libs/compass-<VERSION>.jar`.
Copy it into the `./extensions/` folder of your server.

## Usage
If you start your server, the extension generates an example configuration file (`compass.toml`).
```toml
"opener.material" = "minecraft:compass"
"opener.name" = "<lang:key.keyboard.menu>"
"menu.layout" = "# # # # 1"
"menu.size" = 6
"opener.lore" = "Some Lore<br>second Line"
"menu.title" = "<lang:key.keyboard.menu>"

[["menu.servers"]]
"item.name" = "<gold>Lobby"
"item.lore" = "This is the lobby.<br>A nice place to wait for your friends..."
"item.material" = "minecraft:acacia_sapling"
server = "lobby"
```
